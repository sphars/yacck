# YACCK
YACCK - Yet Another Classless CSS Kit  

[Live demo](https://spncrhrstn.github.io/yacck/)  

YACCK is a classless, responsive CSS kit (framework) that focuses on pure HTML semantic elements. It is inspired by many other similar minimal CSS frameworks, such as [MVP.css](https://github.com/andybrewer/mvp). Meant for use in simple websites and blogs.

Currently a work in progress.

## Goals
* Simple universal layout
* Cross-browser support
* Responsive
* Accessible
* Customization

### Acknowledgements
