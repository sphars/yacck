# YACCK
YACCK - Yet Another Classless CSS Kit  

[Live demo](https://spncrhrstn.github.io/yacck/)  

YACCK is a classless, responsive CSS kit (framework) that focuses on pure HTML semantic elements. It is inspired by many other similar minimal CSS frameworks, such as [MVP.css](https://github.com/andybrewer/mvp) and [new.css](https://github.com/xz/new.css). Meant for use in simple websites and blogs.

Currently a work in progress.

## Goals
* Simple universal layout
* Cross-browser support
* Responsive
* Accessible (work in progress)
* Customization

## Customizing

### Fonts
By default, YACCK uses a font stack of system fonts for sans-serif and monospace, so no external fonts required. However, you are welcome to use your own fonts. The following fonts (in my opinion) work well:

Sans-Serif
* **Rubik**
* Inter
* DM Sans
* Roboto
* Nunito
* Heebo

Monospace
* **Fira Mono**
* Inconsolata
* DM Mono
* Roboto Mono
* Cousine
