YACCK - Yet Another Classless CSS Kit

YACCK is a classless, responsive CSS kit (framework) that focuses on pure HTML semantic elements. It is inspired by many other similar minimal CSS frameworks, such as <a href="https://github.com/andybrewer/mvp">MVP.css</a>. Meant for use in simple websites and blogs.

Test page based on [HTML5 Test Page](https://github.com/cbracco/html5-test-page).

Currently a work in progress.
